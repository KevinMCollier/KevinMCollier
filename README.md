### Hi, I'm Kevin 👋

I'm a **web developer** with a passion for learning.


I became interested in software engineering when I began looking for potential solutions to problems in the education and L&D fields.

My longterm goal is to create apps that improve the way we learn and grow 🚀

💡 **Currently Working On**: Learning ReactJS
